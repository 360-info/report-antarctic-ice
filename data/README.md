## `/data/bedmap2`

This data comes from the [Bedmap2](https://tc.copernicus.org/articles/7/375/2013/tc-7-375-2013.html) project ([Fretwell et al. 2013](https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-7-375-2013)).

Several GeoJSON files are version controlled here:

- `bedmap2_bed_heights.geojson`: polygons representing the height of the bedrock, banded in 1 km increments
- `bedmap2_bed_outline.geojson`: a polygon just representing the border of the bedrock from sea level up
- `bedmap2_surface_outline.geojson`: a polygon representing the border of Antarctica's ice sheet

Several TIF files are not version controlled but are generated by `/analysis/topography/index.qmd` based on the raw Bedmap2 data:

- `bedmap2_bed_small.tif` is a raster of the bedrock height, downsampled to constrain file size
- `bedmap2_surface_small.tif` is a raster of the ice sheet height, downsampled to constrain file size
- `bedmap2_thickness_small.tif` is a raster of the bedrock thickness, downsampled to constrain file size

## `/data/nsidc`

This data comes from the [National Sea and Ice Data Center](https://nsidc.org)â€™s [Sea Ice Index](https://nsidc.org/data/g02135/versions/3) and the [GLIMS Glacier Database](https://nsidc.org/data/nsidc-0272/versions/1).

Several files are version controlled here:

- `glaciers-antarctica.csv`: GLIMS point data on the location of glaciers, constrained to the polar region (< -60 latitude)
- `seaice_media.geojson`: linestrings of the average sea ice boundaries for each month of the year over the 1981-2010 period
- `seaice_media.geojson`: concave hulls of the above sea ice boundary linestrings

A larger set of raw files from the Sea Ice Index and GLIMS are not version controlled but are downloaded or generated by `/analysis/topography/index.qmd`.
