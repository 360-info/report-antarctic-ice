## 💻 Reproduce the analysis

### Quickstart: use the dev container

This project comes with a ready-to-use [dev
container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) that
includes everything you need to reproduce the analysis (or do a similar
one of your own!), including [R](https://r-project.org) and
[Quarto](https://quarto.org).

[![Open in GitHub
Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/360-info/report-antarctic-ice?quickstart=1)

If you have Docker installed, you can build and run the container
locally:

- Download or clone the project
- Open it in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- Run the **Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container** command

Once the container has launched (it might take a few minutes to set up
the first time), you can run the analysis scripts with:

``` sh
quarto render
```

Or look for the `.qmd` files to modify the analysis.

### Manual setup

To setup a development environment manually,

You’ll need to:

- [Download and install Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started)
- [Download the install R](https://www.r-project.org)
- Satisfy the R package dependencies. In R:
  - Install the [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv) package with
    `install.packages("renv")`,
  - Then run `renv::restore()` to install the R package dependencies.
  - (For problems satisfying R package dependencies, refer to [Quarto’s
    documentation on virtual
    environments](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/virtual-environments.html).)

Now, render the `.qmd` files to the `/out` directory with:

``` sh
quarto render
```
